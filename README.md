HTTP
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a set of rules that govern how web browsers and web servers communicate with each other. It's a fundamental part of the internet and is used to deliver web content to users. 

How HTTP works 

When you visit a website, your browser sends an HTTP request to the web server.
The web server responds with an HTTP response.
The browser and web server exchange data as plaintext.

HTTP versions 

HTTP/2

Published in 2015, HTTP/2 is more efficient than previous versions of HTTP. It uses binary frames to break down requests into logical units.

HTTP/3

Published in 2022, HTTP/3 is the successor to HTTP/2. It uses QUIC instead of TCP for transport, which can lead to faster loading times.

Secure HTTP 

HTTPS: HTTPS is a more secure version of HTTP that uses encryption to protect data. Most websites that require sensitive information, like credit card numbers, use HTTPS.
